# Hanzi Movie Method - Sets Configuration
# 13 Sets representing Pinyin Finals
#
# Each set is a location (memory palace) from your life.
# Within each set, there are 5 rooms representing the 5 tones.
#
# Tips for choosing sets:
# - Choose places with strong emotional memories
# - Each place should have at least 4 clearly defined areas
# - The link between the location and the final sound helps memory
# - Consider the "epoch" - the chapter of your life this place represents
