# Hanzi Movie Method - Props Configuration
# Props represent character components (radicals and other parts)
#
# Each prop is an object that represents a character component.
# Choose props based on:
# 1. Appearance - what does the component look like?
# 2. Meaning - what does the component mean?
# 3. Combination - both appearance and meaning
#
# Tips:
# - Props should be tangible, 3D objects you can visualize
# - The more personal the connection, the better
# - Consider how the prop can interact with actors in scenes
#
# This file contains all 214 Kangxi radicals plus common variants.
